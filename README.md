# The ADHD-programmer

## A mountain of useful tools and guides to use them that I've found help maximize my productivity and minimize errors/sloppy code.

Over my years as a graduate student trying to solve a lot of problems, I have often relied on wonderful succinct guides written by individuals with a niche.                                           
I am a relatively recent programmer, so a lot of the executive-function tasks that are required for doing things like writing good code comments and documenting workflow are challenging. This is a collection of resources for some past version of myself who was trying to learn how to code, struggled with the organization required and would just like a little bit of help identifying tools and setting them up to make the transition from disorganized mess to clean code a bit easier.

Feel free to submit a pull request if you want to add something to this document that you've found helpful in your work to organize yourself. I primarily work in R and Python, so my tools will focus around those languages, but this doesn't have to include only those things.

This is definitely a work in progress, I will upload more as time goes on.

### Python
